## Motivation
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an extremely interesting and versatile technique based on PyTorch that brings many innovative applications and possibilities in the artistic and creative fields. Through this project, I aim to expand my knowledge in computer vision and deep learning by learning and understanding the principles and implementation of the algorithm in depth.  
## How to use
The notebooks I use follow these steps:  
  
1.Load images: Load the content image and the style image.  
2.Preprocess images: Preprocess the images.  
3.Build the model: Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG19) to extract image features.  
4.Define the loss function: Include content loss and style loss.  
5.Optimize: Transform the content image into a new image with the style image features through the optimization process.

## Learning process
In this project, I conducted two experiments to explore and understand the capabilities of Neural Style Transfer.  
### Analyzing the effects of VGG19 Layer changes on Style Transfer Result
Firstly, I attempted to modify different layers of the VGG19 model to compare the impact of each layer on the style transfer results.

In **2.Compare _low-level detailed features.ipynb** and **2.Compare _high-level global features.ipynb**, I extracted lower-level detail features (such as fine details and textures) and higher-level global features (such as shapes and structures) respectively, and compared the results.

**Detail Feature Image：**

· Rich in details, retaining more texture and edge information from the original image.  
· Overall color and details are complex, showcasing more subtle elements of the artistic style.  

**Global Feature Image：**  
![high](https://github.com/Morlynn/Coding3-Final/assets/163441891/59aa07cc-e83c-4b4c-a2de-62cdd68d383f)  
· Emphasizes overall structure and shape, with prominent colors and large areas of style.  
· Stronger global consistency, with a more cohesive feel but less detailed.  


The comparison shows that images with low-level features focus on details and textures, while images with high-level features emphasize overall structure and shapes. Choosing different feature layers can achieve different style transfer effects based on your needs.
### The Impact of Different Optimizers on Neural Style Transfer Results
In **1.Artistic Neural Style Transfer.ipynb**, I extracted both global and detailed features using the torch.optim.Adam optimizer. In **3.Testing L-BFGS Optimizer.ipynb**, I utilized the torch.optim.LBFGS optimizer. The results generated by both optimizers were then compared to analyze their effectiveness.  
  
**Adam Optimizer:**
