## Motivation
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an extremely interesting and versatile technique based on PyTorch that brings many innovative applications and possibilities in the artistic and creative fields. Through this project, I aim to expand my knowledge in computer vision and deep learning by learning and understanding the principles and implementation of the algorithm in depth.  
## How to use
The notebooks I use follow these steps:  
  
1.Load images: Load the content image and the style image.  
2.Preprocess images: Preprocess the images.  
3.Build the model: Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG19) to extract image features.  
4.Define the loss function: Include content loss and style loss.  
5.Optimize: Transform the content image into a new image with the style image features through the optimization process.
